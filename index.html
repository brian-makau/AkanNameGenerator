    <p>
        Hello! Welcome to the Akan name generator. In West Africa, specifically Ghana, newborns are given special names depending on the day 
        they are born. Diverse ethnic groups have variants and meanings as a symbol of cultural integrity and ancestral 
        affiliation. For the people of Ghana it is the Akan Names. These are names given to children based on the day of the week that they 
        were born. Would you like to find out your Akan name? Then fill out this simple form and find out.
